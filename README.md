# Chip for Hire

A online system helps shopkeepers to schedule the robot Chip ([REEM robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REEM) built by PAL robotics) to give away samples and survey customers using his touchscreen, in a retail setting. The system is used with [Chip on Duty](https://github.com/le-kang/chip-on-duty) application which runs on the robot.
